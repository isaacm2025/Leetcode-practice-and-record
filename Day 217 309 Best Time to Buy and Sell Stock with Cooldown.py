'''You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of NeetCoin on the ith day.

You may buy and sell one NeetCoin multiple times with the following restrictions:

After you sell your NeetCoin, you cannot buy another one on the next day (i.e., there is a cooldown period of one day).
You may only own at most one NeetCoin at a time.
You may complete as many transactions as you like.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [1,3,4,0,4]

Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 0 (price = 1) and sell on day 1 (price = 3), profit = 3-1 = 2. Then buy on day 3 (price = 0) and sell on day 4 (price = 4), profit = 4-0 = 4. Total profit is 2 + 4 = 6.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [1]

Output: 0
Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 5000
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

#time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of prices. This is because we are using memoization to store the results of previously computed states, and we only compute each state once
#space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of prices. This is because we are using a dictionary to store the results of previously computed states, and in the worst case, we may need to store the results for all n states.

#time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of prices. This is because we are iterating through the prices array once.
#space complexity: O(1) because we are using a constant amount of space to store the variables dp1_buy, dp1_sell, and dp2_buy, regardless of the size of the input array prices.
