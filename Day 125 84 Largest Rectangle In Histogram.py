'''You are given an array of integers heights where heights[i] represents the height of a bar. The width of each bar is 1.

Return the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed among the bars.

Note: This chart is known as a histogram.

Example 1:

Input: heights = [7,1,7,2,2,4]

Output: 8
Example 2:

Input: heights = [1,3,7]

Output: 7
Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 1000.
0 <= heights[i] <= 1000'''

#time O(n) because we are iterating through the heights array three times, and each element is pushed and popped at most once
#space O(n) because of the stack and the leftMost and rightMost arrays
