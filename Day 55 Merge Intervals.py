'''Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

You may return the answer in any order.

Note: Intervals are non-overlapping if they have no common point. For example, [1, 2] and [3, 4] are non-overlapping, but [1, 2] and [2, 3] are overlapping.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[1,5],[6,7]]

Output: [[1,5],[6,7]]
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]

Output: [[1,3]]
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 1000
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= start <= end <= 1000'''
