'''Given a 2-D grid of characters board and a string word, return true if the word is present in the grid, otherwise return false.

For the word to be present it must be possible to form it with a path in the board with horizontally or vertically neighboring cells. The same cell may not be used more than once in a word.

Example 1:



Input: 
board = [
  ["A","B","C","D"],
  ["S","A","A","T"],
  ["A","C","A","E"]
],
word = "CAT"

Output: true
Example 2:



Input: 
board = [
  ["A","B","C","D"],
  ["S","A","A","T"],
  ["A","C","A","E"]
],
word = "BAT"

Output: false
Constraints:

1 <= board.length, board[i].length <= 5
1 <= word.length <= 10
board and word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.'''

#time complexity: O(m * 4^n) where m is the number of cells in the board and n is the length of the word. In the worst case, we might explore all 4 directions for each character in the word.
#space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the word. The space is used by the recursion stack and the path set to keep track of visited cells.
