'''Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of dictionary words.

You are allowed to reuse words in the dictionary an unlimited number of times. You may assume all dictionary words are unique.

Example 1:

Input: s = "neetcode", wordDict = ["neet","code"]

Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "neetcode" can be split into "neet" and "code".

Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","ape"]

Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be split into "apple", "pen" and "apple". Notice that we can reuse words and also not use all the words.

Example 3:

Input: s = "catsincars", wordDict = ["cats","cat","sin","in","car"]

Output: false
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 200
1 <= wordDict.length <= 100
1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20
s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.'''

#time complexity: O(n * m * t) where n is the length of the string s, m is the number of words in wordDict, and t is the average length of the words in wordDict.
#space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the string s.
