'''Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, return true if the trees are equivalent, otherwise return false.

Two binary trees are considered equivalent if they share the exact same structure and the nodes have the same values.

Example 1:



Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

Output: true
Example 2:



Input: p = [4,7], q = [4,null,7]

Output: false
Example 3:



Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,3,2]

Output: false
Constraints:

0 <= The number of nodes in both trees <= 100.
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

#time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the trees. We visit each node once.
#space complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the trees. 
# In the best case, the trees are balanced and the height is log(n), so the space complexity is O(log(n)). 
# In the worst case, the space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive call stack.
