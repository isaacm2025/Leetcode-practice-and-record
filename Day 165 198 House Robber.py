'''You are given an integer array nums where nums[i] represents the amount of money the ith house has. The houses are arranged in a straight line, i.e. the ith house is the neighbor of the (i-1)th and (i+1)th house.

You are planning to rob money from the houses, but you cannot rob two adjacent houses because the security system will automatically alert the police if two adjacent houses were both broken into.

Return the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,3,3]

Output: 4
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[2] = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,9,8,3,6]

Output: 16
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 2 + 8 + 6 = 16.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 100

#time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the nums array. The algorithm computes the maximum amount of money that can be robbed starting from each house only once and stores it in the memoization array.
#space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the nums array. The algorithm uses a memoization array of size n to store the maximum amount of money that can be robbed starting from each house, and the recursion stack can go up to n in the worst case.
