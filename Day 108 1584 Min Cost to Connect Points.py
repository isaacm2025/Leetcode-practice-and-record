'''You are given a 2-D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. Each points[i] represents a distinct point on a 2-D plane.

The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between the two points, i.e. |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.

Return the minimum cost to connect all points together, such that there exists exactly one path between each pair of points.

Example 1:



Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2]]

Output: 10
Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 1000
-1,000,000 <= xi, yi <= 1,000,000
All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.

#time complexity is O(N^2 log N) because we are building the adjacency list with O(N^2) and then we are using a min heap to get the minimum cost edge which takes O(log N) time. The space complexity is O(N^2) because we are storing the adjacency list.
