'''Given a square n x n matrix of integers matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.

You must rotate the matrix in-place. Do not allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:



Input: matrix = [
  [1,2],
  [3,4]
]

Output: [
  [3,1],
  [4,2]
]
Example 2:



Input: matrix = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
]

Output: [
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
Constraints:

n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 20
-1000 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1000

#time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the input matrix, due to the nested loops.
#space complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the input matrix, due to the space used for the rotated matrix, O(1) if we don't consider the space used for the rotated matrix.
