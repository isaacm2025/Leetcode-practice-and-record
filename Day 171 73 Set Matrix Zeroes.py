'''Given an m x n matrix of integers matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must update the matrix in-place.

Follow up: Could you solve it using O(1) space?

Example 1:



Input: matrix = [
  [0,1],
  [1,0]
]

Output: [
  [0,0],
  [0,0]
]

Example 2:



Input: matrix = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,0,5],
  [6,7,8]
]

Output: [
  [1,0,3],
  [0,0,0],
  [6,0,8]
]
Constraints:

1 <= matrix.length, matrix[0].length <= 100
-2^31 <= matrix[i][j] <= (2^31) - 1

#time complexity: O(m * n) since we are iterating through the matrix
#space complexity: O(m + n) since we are using two additional arrays to keep track
