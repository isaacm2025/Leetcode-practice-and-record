'''You are given the head of a singly linked-list.

The positions of a linked list of length = 7 for example, can intially be represented as:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Reorder the nodes of the linked list to be in the following order:

[0, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]

Notice that in the general case for a list of length = n the nodes are reordered to be in the following order:

[0, n-1, 1, n-2, 2, n-3, ...]

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, but instead you must reorder the nodes themselves.

Example 1:

Input: head = [2,4,6,8]

Output: [2,8,4,6]
Example 2:

Input: head = [2,4,6,8,10]

Output: [2,10,4,8,6]
Constraints:

1 <= Length of the list <= 1000.
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
